# Phase 6: Profile Management - Change Password ✅

## Overview
Implementation of password change functionality that allows authenticated users (doctors and patients) to change their password directly from their profile pages.

## Feature Requirements
- User can access password change form from their profile page
- User must enter their current password for verification
- User enters new password (must be different from current)
- User confirms new password
- Password is changed immediately upon successful submission
- User receives confirmation email after password change

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend (Already Existing) ✅

The backend already has complete password change functionality:

#### Endpoint
```
PUT /api/auth/change-password
```

#### Controller Function
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`

```javascript
export const changePassword = async (req, res)
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Requires authentication (protected route)
- ✅ Validates current password
- ✅ Ensures new password is different from current
- ✅ Hashes new password automatically (via pre-save middleware)
- ✅ Sends confirmation email
- ✅ Logs password change event for audit trail
- ✅ Updates `passwordChangedAt` timestamp

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "currentPassword": "string (required)",
  "newPassword": "string (required)"
}
```

**Success Response** (200):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password changed successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- 400: Current password is incorrect
- 400: New password must be different from current password
- 404: User not found
- 401: Not authenticated
- 500: Server error

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### A. Auth Service (`frontend/src/services/auth.service.ts`)

**New Method Added**:
```typescript
async changePassword(data: { 
  currentPassword: string; 
  newPassword: string 
})
```

**Features**:
- Makes PUT request to `/api/auth/change-password`
- Includes credentials for authentication
- Returns success/error response
- Full JSDoc documentation

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
await authService.changePassword({
  currentPassword: 'oldPassword123',
  newPassword: 'newSecurePassword456'
});
```

#### B. ChangePasswordForm Component

**File**: `frontend/src/components/ChangePasswordForm.tsx`

**Features**:
✅ **Form Fields**:
- Current Password (with show/hide toggle)
- New Password (with show/hide toggle)
- Confirm Password (with show/hide toggle)

✅ **Validation**:
- All fields required
- New password must be at least 6 characters
- New password must be different from current
- Password confirmation must match new password
- Real-time error clearing on input change

✅ **UI/UX**:
- Loading state during submission
- Success message with auto-clear
- Error message display with icon
- Password visibility toggle (eye icon)
- Disabled state during loading
- Security tips section
- Responsive dark mode support
- Professional styling with Tailwind CSS

✅ **Security Tips Included**:
- Use strong passwords with mix of characters
- Don't reuse passwords from other accounts
- Change password regularly
- Never share password

**Props**:
```typescript
interface ChangePasswordFormProps {
  onSuccess?: () => void;  // Optional callback after successful change
}
```

**Component Structure**:
```tsx
<ChangePasswordForm 
  onSuccess={() => {
    // Optional: Show notification, redirect, etc.
  }}
/>
```

#### C. Profile Pages Integration

**Modified Files**:
1. `frontend/src/pages/PatientProfile.tsx`
2. `frontend/src/pages/DoctorProfile.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Imported `ChangePasswordForm` component
- ✅ Added component below profile update form
- ✅ Added success callback to show notification
- ✅ Maintains consistent spacing and layout

**Integration Code**:
```tsx
{/* Change Password Section */}
<div className="mt-8">
  <ChangePasswordForm 
    onSuccess={() => {
      setSuccess('Password changed successfully! Please use your new password for future logins.');
      setTimeout(() => setSuccess(null), 5000);
    }}
  />
</div>
```

## User Flow

### Complete Password Change Flow

1. **User navigates to profile page** (`/profile`)
   - For patients: PatientProfile component
   - For doctors: DoctorProfile component

2. **User scrolls to "Change Password" section**

   - Clean, professional UI with lock icon

3. **User fills out form**:
   - Enters current password
   - Enters new password (min 6 characters)
   - Confirms new password
   - Can toggle password visibility with eye icon

4. **Frontend validation**:
   - Checks all fields are filled
   - Validates password length (≥6 characters)
   - Ensures new password differs from current
   - Verifies password confirmation matches
   - Shows error if validation fails

5. **User clicks "Change Password" button**:
   - Button shows loading spinner
   - Form fields are disabled during submission

6. **Backend processing**:
   - Verifies current password
   - Checks new password is different
   - Hashes new password
   - Updates user document
   - Sends confirmation email
   - Logs password change event

7. **Success response**:
   - ✅ Green success message displayed
   - ✅ Form is cleared automatically
   - ✅ Confirmation email sent to user
   - ✅ Optional callback executed (profile page notification)
   - ✅ Message auto-clears after 2 seconds

8. **Error handling**:
   - ❌ Shows error message if current password is wrong
   - ❌ Shows error if validation fails
   - ❌ Descriptive error messages for each scenario

## Security Features

**Authentication**: Required (JWT token in cookie)

**Request Headers**:
```
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: token=<jwt_token>

## Configuration

### Password Requirements
Current settings (can be modified in validation):
- **Minimum Length**: 6 characters
- **Maximum Length**: No limit (reasonable limit recommended)
- **Complexity**: No special requirements (can be added)

### Customization Options

To change password requirements:
1. Update frontend validation in `ChangePasswordForm.tsx`
2. Update backend validation in `validateChangePassword` middleware

To add password complexity:
```javascript
// Example: Require uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
const passwordRegex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$/;
```

### Potential Improvements
1. **Password Strength Meter**: Visual indicator of password strength
2. **Password History**: Prevent reuse of last N passwords
3. **Force Password Change**: Require change after X days
4. **2FA Verification**: Require OTP for password change
5. **Password Recovery**: "Forgot password" link in change form
6. **Success Redirect**: Option to redirect after change
7. **Toast Notifications**: Global toast instead of inline messages
