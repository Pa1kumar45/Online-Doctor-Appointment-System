## What is this?

This is a full-stack web application that helps patients book appointments with doctors online. Think of it as a digital clinic where patients can browse doctors, schedule appointments, and doctors can manage their practice - all in one place. Plus, there's a powerful admin dashboard to keep everything running smoothly.

We built this using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (the MERN stack), with TypeScript for better code quality and Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look.

## Why We Built This

Healthcare should be simple and accessible. This project addresses the common frustration of booking doctor appointments - no more endless phone calls or waiting in queues. Everything happens online, securely and efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

We chose these technologies because they work great together and are widely used in the industry:

**Frontend:**
- React 19 with TypeScript - for a robust, type-safe user interface
- Vite - super fast development and build tool
- Tailwind CSS v4 - for beautiful, responsive styling
- React Router - smooth navigation between pages
- Axios - handles all API requests cleanly

**Backend:**
- Node.js & Express.js - the backbone of the server
- MongoDB with Mongoose - flexible database for storing all data
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - secure authentication
- Bcrypt - keeps passwords safe with strong encryption
- Nodemailer - sends emails for OTP and notifications
- Multer - handles file uploads (profile pictures)

---

##   Getting Started

### What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have:
- Node.js (version 18 or newer)
- MongoDB (you can use a local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- A Gmail account (for sending emails)
- Git (to clone the repo)

### Quick Setup

Here's how to get everything running on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pa1kumar45/Online-Doctor-Appointment-System.git
cd Online-Doctor-Appointment-System
```

2. **Set up the backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

This will install all necessary backend dependencies including:
- `express` - Web framework
- `mongoose` - MongoDB ODM
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT authentication
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- `nodemailer` - Email service (for OTP and notifications)
- `multer` - File upload handling (for profile pictures)
- `express-validator` - Input validation
- `cookie-parser` - Cookie handling
- `cors` - Cross-origin resource sharing
- `dotenv` - Environment variables

3. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with these settings:
```env
# Your MongoDB connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/healthconnect

# Or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud):
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/healthconnect

# Server settings
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Security (change this!)
JWT_SECRET=make-this-a-long-random-string-in-production
JWT_EXPIRE=7

# Email settings (Gmail)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=HealthConnect <noreply@healthconnect.com>
```

**Important:** For Gmail, you'll need to generate an "App Password" (see the Gmail Setup section below).

4. **Create an admin account**
```bash
npm run create-admin
```
Save the credentials it generates - you'll need them to access the admin panel!

5. **Set up the frontend**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

This will install all necessary frontend dependencies including:
- `react` & `react-dom` - React framework
- `typescript` - Type safety
- `vite` - Build tool and dev server
- `react-router-dom` - Client-side routing
- `axios` - HTTP client for API calls
- `tailwindcss` - Styling framework
- `lucide-react` - Icon library

Create a `.env` file in the frontend folder:
```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

6. **Start everything up**

Open two terminal windows:

Terminal 1 (Backend):
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Terminal 2 (Frontend):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

7. **Open your browser**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

That's it! You should now see the app running.

## üìß Gmail Setup (Important!)

To send emails (OTP, password reset, etc.), you need to set up Gmail properly:

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Go to Security ‚Üí App passwords
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy that password into your `.env` file as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

The app password is different from your regular Gmail password - it's a special code that Gmail generates for apps.
