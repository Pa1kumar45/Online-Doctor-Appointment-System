## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start

**Error:** `Cannot find module 'socket.io'`  
**Fix:** Run `npm install` in backend folder

### Frontend Won't Start

**Error:** `Cannot find module 'socket.io-client'`  
**Fix:** Run `npm install` in frontend folder

### TypeScript Errors

**Error:** Property 'mode' does not exist  
**Fix:** Changes already applied, restart dev server

### Database Errors

**Issue:** Old appointments have `mode` field  
**Fix:** No action needed, field is optional and will be ignored

## 📝 Optional Database Cleanup

If you want to clean old data (optional):

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB and run:
use medical_app

// Remove mode field from all appointments
db.appointments.updateMany(
  { mode: { $exists: true } },
  { $unset: { mode: "" } }
)

// Optional: Drop messages collection if not needed
db.messages.drop()
```
